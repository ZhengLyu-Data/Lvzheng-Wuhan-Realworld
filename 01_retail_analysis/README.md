## 📓 Notebook Format Notice

The main analysis file is named `Notebook.ipynb`, and it is a standard **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** created and executed in **Google Colab**.

⚠️ The filename has been intentionally kept as `Notebook.ipynb` to preserve the notebook's full execution history and cell outputs. Renaming directly in GitHub can break the file structure or delete outputs.

You can open and interact with the notebook directly in your browser via Google Colab:

➡️ **How to open in Colab:**
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click `File → Open notebook → GitHub` tab
3. Paste this repository URL:  
   `https://github.com/ZhengLyu-Data/Lvzheng-Wuhan-Data`
4. Open the `01_retail_analysis/Notebook.ipynb` file
